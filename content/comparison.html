          <h1>Feathers vs. X</h1>

          <p>The following sections compare Feathers to other software choices that seem similar or may overlap with the use cases of Feathers. Due to the bias of these comparisons being on the Feathers website, we attempt to only use facts. Below you can find a feature comparison table and in each section you can get more detailed comparisons. If you find something invalid or out of date in the comparisons, please <a class="primary" href="https://github.com/feathersjs/website/issues/new" target="blank">create an issue</a> and we'll address it as soon as possible.
